	<h2>What is rush hour?</h2>
	<p>Here is a definition from <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a>:</p>
	<blockquote cite="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rush_hour">
	A rush hour or peak hour is a part of the day during which traffic congestion on roads and crowding on public transport is at its highest. Normally, this happens twice every weekdayâ€”once in the morning and once in the evening, the times during when the most people commute. The term is often used for a period of peak congestion that may last for more than one hour.
	</blockquote>
	<h2>Why does this matter?</h2>
	<p>Rush hour and traffic congestion is a problem for several reasons:</p>
	<ul>
	 <li>Stress</li>
	 <li>Time wasted</li>
	 <li>Environment</li>
	</ul>
	<h2>But carpools have been tried before!</h2>
	<p>True.  To me, this validates how important of a problem this is to solve. But now, more than ever, is a time where mobile devices, sharing personal information, and using service-oriented software is normal.</p>
