<h2> Why did CCN develop?</h2>
	<p>
	Different eras of network development existed because of different network needs, and the argument for Content-Centric Networking, or CCN, is that the Internet has modern needs that outdate its current architecture.  The early development of telecommunications was focused on the nonexistence of physical architecture that connected telephones across the country, and as a result fail-safe and reliable component parts were high design priorities.  In the early computing era afterwards, the network paradigm shifted to one designed with "resource-sharing" in mind, where a few technological hubs had costly and scarce computer systems that were in high demand<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>.  This scarcity made networking protocols that abstracted host-to-host communication for remote-use extremely valuable.  The Internet Protocol, as described in RFC791, was designed for this two-way exchange and abstracted it as a conversation between two machines to provide access to resources one machine had that the other did not<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup>.  Now, it is widely held that this networking model of conversations on which the Internet rests on is mismatched with the content-distribution network that the Internet generally acts as, and CCN's goal is to better fit the modern-day Internet's current typical uses.
	</p>

<h2>The Host-Centric Model</h2>
	<p>
	Not only is the Internet Protocol designed for a host-centric model, its specifications are in themselves "limited in scope" specifically to be lightweight and adaptive<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">[2]</a></sup>.  The Internet Protocol's key objective is solely to move sequences of bits from "a source to a destination"[2].  For large-scale system adoption, this particular design decision to be barebones with no added functionality was an excellent choice.  The mantra of "do one thing only, and one thing well" made sense for IP to provide a universal network layer for packet-switched routing systems.  Specifically targeting this objective helped IP succeed in connecting existing subnetworks to each other relatively painlessly, and additional functionality can easily be overlaid on top of it. IP only provides unreliable best effort delivery, but when used in conjunction with TCP as the transport layer, the result is a reliable end-to-end communication system<sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">[3]</a></sup>.  When further extended upon with SSL or HTTPS, these connections are encapsulated with added security.
	</p>
	<p>
	Despite these seemingly positive characteristics, Van Jacobson, a primary contributor to the TCP/IP scheme, et al. argue that IP undermines network functionality that could significantly improve the Internet experience in terms of content distribution, such as in information's "availability, security and location-dependence"<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>. Framed from a content-centric perspective, information is only available to be distributed from the original distributor, limiting the possibility of in-network caching and multicasted interactions.  Additionally, the content itself is difficult to authenticate and secure because of its "opacity," and instead must rely on securitization of the "containers"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">[4]</a></sup>.  All of these factors, they argue, tie to the fact that TCP/IP is tightly bounded to the model of host-to-host communication and inhibit the opportunity for network effects that improve with scale.
	</p>

<h2>The Content-Centric Model</h2>
<p>
CCN is different from Host-Centric architectures because of how it names, and thus values, information over location.  While IP necessitates that each packet has a destination and source label associated with it, CCN binds a name to the data itself, allowing the packets to be location-indendent yet still functional.  The effects of this distinction cause significant changes in information characteristics such as in opacity, security, flow, and mobility<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">[6]</a></sup>.
</p>
	<ul><li>
	<b>Information Opacity</b><br>
	Part of the distinction between CCN and host-centric models is the "context" that each model provides to nodes of the network<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">[4]</a></sup>.  IP, for example, uses the destination and source locations to provide sufficient context to network nodes to blindly forward the packets to their appropriate end-points.  By design, the packet information is opaque to the network.  In contrast, CCN provides context to the packet data by naming the data intrinsically, effectively decoupling the data from the end-points.  As a result, the data is necessarily more visible to the network and allows network nodes to handle the packets with more flexibility.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Security</b> <br>
	In host-centric models, because the data itself is opaque to the network, the network can at best provide security to the "containers" holding the data<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">[4]</a></sup>.  Effectively, the security provided to the data is a wrapper which cannot secure the data, but rather depends on verifying and limiting trust with other parties.  On the other hand, because of its separation from location, CCN must secure the information itself by allowing the content to be signed with its name, giving the data "provenance" to be trustable without being directly linked to its distributor<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">[9]</a></sup>.  The data becomes self-signing and independent.
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Flow</b><br>
	CCN generalizes the conversation model of host-centric networks to one of pure distribution.  As a result, the interaction between nodes gains multicast capabilities, and the data is permitted to be retained and moved in totally different ways through the network. Particularly, the information is disassociated from a particular host, and therefore the information can be distributed via any host with a copy of sought-after information.  
	</li>
	<li>
	<b>Mobility</b><br>
	By decoupling the content from providers, CCN is characteristically more mobile than host-centric networks<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">[6]</a></sup>.  Content can be distributed without a stable connection between two specified hosts, and therefore the network is significantly more resilient to lost connections<sup><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">[6]</a></sup>.  In IP, mobility means that hosts can change addresses, and the packet delivery headers by extension need to change to reflect this change of address.  In CCN, the packet headers are unaffected, meaning that the content-seekers can still get access to the information using headers that they expect.
	</li></ul>

<h2>How would a CCN work?</h2>
	<p>
	First, the general protocol needs to be elaborated on.  At a high-level, two primitive message types are passed through the network: Interest messages and Data response messages<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">[1]</a></sup>.  Content-seekers broadcast Interests that name a particular Data, and  any node that receives an Interest that has the matching Data can relay the Data back towards the consumer.  In order to have this functionality, the CCN routers need to be necessarily "stateful" instead of based on the "stateless" design found in RFC791<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">[11]</a></sup>.  This design requires three data structures, a Forwarding Information Base for forwarding Interests through the network, a Pending Interest Table for storing pending Interests that have not yet been resolved, and a Cache for caching Data and handling potential future Interests.
	</p>
	<p>
	While this architecture is straightforward enough, a difficult conceptual leap to make is how a CCN-based Web would be functional without the use domain names and DNS, a fundamental way people understand how to interact with the Web.  Because DNS maps domain names to IP addresses and thus locations that users expect to look for data in, removing the networking layer's reliance on location makes this service unnecessary.  Yet, these domain names are vital to the way consumers find information and content on the Web today. Even so, a number of projects have looked into a number of common scenarios, including "social networks," "content dissemenation," and others that resulted to be feasible<sup><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">[10]</a></sup>.
	</p>

<h2>Performance due to CCN</h2>
	<h3>Security</h3>
	<p>
	Smetters and Jacobson note that in order for content to be "reliably [assessed]" by the receiver, three properties of "validity, provenance, and relevance" must be easily visible<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">[12]</a></sup>.  CCN provides this capability as a result of the tightly bounded relationship of content to name. The Data can be "self-certifying" and publicaly verifiable, thus allowing for "fine-grained trust and privacy"<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">[4]</a></sup>.  As a result, the security of the packets are directly matched to the content and not indirectly matched to the senders and receivers.  Because it is possible to secure the content itself, the opportunity for vulnerabilities and loopholes is significantly diminished.
	</p>	
	<h3>Flow Control</h3>
	<p>
	The most explicit benefit of CCN comes out of the increased ability for the network to both propogate information using a number of different hosts as well as keep a robustness of the system with fewer opportunities for load-based point-failures.  With the extended abilities of routers between content originators and content seekers, traffic does not naturally funnel to a point-source in the same way as in IP<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">[4]</a></sup>.  With increasing demand, more hosts near the source are able to be used to effectively distribute content.  Even more, traditional Denial of Service attacks are predicted to be less effective<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">[13]</a></sup>.  While not invulnerable, the distributed nature of the content makes most attacks that intend to bring down specific hosts much less of a threat. Still, other issues arise naturally from this different architecture.  Traditional DoS attacks are thwarted, but new types of attacks are possible which could severely limit a CCN architecture, including "Interest Flooding and Content/Cache Poisoning"<sup><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">[13]</a></sup>.
	</p>

<h2>Relationship to IDS principles</h2>
	<p>
	Idempotence is a principle that CCN strongly encourages by making the elementary interactions between messages be that of Interests and Data Responses.  With a given Interest, any subsequent Interests with identical names can expect an identical response to the first, and as a result in-network caching becomes easier to manage.  Naming, however, in the CCN framework becomes much harder to rationalize about.  The DNS framework on which the current Internet rests has its issues, but conceptually grasping how clients and distributors can agree upon a common naming scheme is difficult, especially in the context of Web exploration.  In any case, a naming authority is necessary to prevent naming conflicts but at the same time unwieldy when it comes to scalability.  
	</p>
	<p>
	Additionally, CCN is a generalization of host-centric networking and extends the naming space to go beyond locations.  As a result, it is viable for CCN to be an "overlay" on top of TCP/IP that does not necessitate a universal "clean-slate" to be adopted<sup><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">[4]</a></sup>.  This generalization is excellent for adoption, and eventually it would be possible for tasks that are specifically host-centric to still be doable. Therefore, even Interests that are narrowly specific and intended for a particular host could still use TCP/IP services to get a desired "conversational" exchange.  In essence, CCN is general enough to encapsulate host-centric networking so that its adoption would not compete with TCP/IP, but rather extend the Internet's functionality.
	</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>
	<p>
	The Internet community appears to understand that this is a reasonable next-step architecture.  Most of the support for CCN come from a variety of projects and research done by academic institutions and research-oriented groups.  Still, the adoption of CCN will take significant time to come into full effect.  The added functionality necessary for routers to fully employ CCN requires a large-scale deployment of new software architectures, and naturally any type of rollout to a network as large as the Internet will take time.  The upside, however, is that CCN architectures are viable overlays that can be gradually deployed with minimal effects to the network as a whole.  As a result, slow integration and adoption is possible without full-scale overhauls.
