 <div class="qa">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Describe briefly Tim Berners-Lee's reasons for creating the Web. What influenced him to build it,
in what environment was he working, and what were the short and long term goals he was trying to achieve (a paragraph
or two is fine &#8212; this is just to make sure you are up on the background for Tim's work) </li>
<li class="a">
<p>Tim Berners's Lee creating of the Web was an iterative process of integrating many types of ideas.  For one, he had developed a program called Enquire to help him connect things somewhat spontaneously, and this allowed him to develop the idea of "anything being connected with anything."  He was also working at CERN, a place where many different collaborators on vastly different systems needed a way to share resources, ideas, and experiments. </p>
<p>
His short-term goals were limited.  They started as filling a need that CERN had, whether it was building a simple documentation system for contacts or developing a remote procedure call that allowed users to run code from other people's machines.  His long term goals were more about universally connecting everything with anything.  He wanted to demonstrate the "connective aspect of information."
</p>
</li>

<li class="q">Identify and briefly describe at least eight technical challenges that had to be met as Tim created the Web. 
<em>You will not find all the answers set out explicitly in the book. Use your knowledge of computer
systems and your imagination to figure out the sorts of challenges he would have to overcome.</em> Explain each of the eight briefly (one or a few sentences each, unless you care to say more) :</li>
<li class="a">Technical challenges included:
<ol>
<li><b>Universality:</b>In order to reach everything, TBL had to find a way to get different computers with different operating systems to communicate with each other.   </li>
<li><b>Scalability:</b>In order to make the system larger, TBL had to design a system with no central link database so that no one resource would have to encapsulate all of the information necessary for the Web to exist. </li>
<li><b>Addressing</b>TBL had to design a scheme so that any information object could be addressable with a unique identifier. </li>
<li><b>Persistence:</b> Unlike email, TBL wanted to make the information space have persistence (memory), without needing to focus on link maintenance.</li>
<li><b>Minimal protocols:</b> TBL had to design a system with minimally restrictive standards to make sure the Web was as compatible as possible.</li>
<li><b>Non-compilable:</b>TBL had to come up with a language that could be communicated across the Internet without needing to be compiled and could be run instantaneously. </li>
<li><b>Web Browser Design:</b> The web browser needed to be able to work with many different types of computers so that all information could be viewable on different machines.</li>
<li><b>Hyperlinking and Networking:</b>  TBL had to design a system where hyperlinks could fit into a text editor with minimal expense for development.</li>
</ol>

</li>

<li class="q">Identify and briefly describe at least two organizational, legal and/or economic challenges that had to be met as Tim created the Web. Explain each briefly:</li>
<li class="a">Organizational, legal or economic challenges included:
<ol>
<li><b>Cultural Disconnect:</b>The environment at CERN was definitely an advantage, but the nature of working at a physics institution made it difficult for TBL to really persuade any in-house sources of funding to bite into his project.  At its heart, CERN was not focused on information technology, and additionally the competitive nature at CERN made it difficult for his work to not be written off as just another "documentation solution" being peddled by someone working there. Additionally, working at CERN made it difficult for his code to port or be mobile as soon as he left CERN.</li>
<li><b>Institutional Loyalty:</b>By nature of being in Europe, it is possible that getting groups on-board with taking on an American-originated infrastructure such as the Internet was difficult.  More generally, the vast numbers of loyalties to different software, hardware, and architectures made TBLâ€™s decisions to stick to developing on an NeXT platform divisive.  He continually had to make decisions about the markup language structure, the network protocols, and the web browser development that made adopting the World Wide Web difficult.
