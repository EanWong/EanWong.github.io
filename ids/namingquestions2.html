		QUESTION

 <div class="qa">
<p>Please answer each of the following questions.</p>

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">Consider the URI <code>http://example.com/homepage.html</code>.
According to TAG Finding <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/metaDataInURI-31">The use of Metadata in URIs</a>, <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a> and other applicable 
specifications, which of the following statements is/are <em>definitely true</em>?</li>
<li class="nest">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">The URI is a reference to an HTML document?</li>
<li class="a">Maybe.  While it is probably good practice, URIs do not require the name of the resource to describe anything beyond a way to identify a resource.  The "metadata" of the URI is not guaranteed accurate.</li>
<li class="q">The URI is absolute?</li>
<li class="a">True.  Although relative referencing is allowed, in this scenario the "//" implies an absolute path that follows.</li>
<li class="q">If you do an HTTP GET on this URI from anywhere in the world, you will get the same thing? Which principle that we studied does this illustrate?</li>
<li class="a">This is guaranteed, within a "short" period of time.  The illustrated principle is "idempotence."  This is to reinforce the architecture for caching, and in TBL's words, "it leads to the whole concept of the Web as an information space rather than a computing program." The thinking is that GET should not change the "state" of the resource.</li>
</ol>

</li>
<li class="q">While browsing the Web, you follow a link by clicking on text that says: "Great Prices on Shoes".
You do indeed get a Web page, and you notice that the URI
in your address bar reads: <code>http://greatdeals.com/discounts?item=shoes</code>
According to TAG Finding <a href="http://www.w3.org/2001/tag/doc/metaDataInURI-31">The use of Metadata in URIs</a>:</li>
<li class="nest">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">The Web page you get should
be about discounts on shoes? </li>
<li class="a">While not guaranteed, the web page should, under good practice principles, be about discounts on shoes.  Usually, this metadata, if not intended to deceive the client, is for the benefit of the user.</li>
<li class="q">If you change the URI to read <code>http://greatdeals.com/discounts?item=gloves</code>, any Web page you get should be about discounts on gloves?</li>
<li class="a">Maybe.  This is not guaranteed at all by the owner of the resources.  It is possible that the termuses a search engine to come up with discounts, but again, the transformation of that URI is not guaranteed to be usable.</li>
</ol>
</li>

<li class="q">Consider the URI <code>http://example.com/maps?lat=42.408724&amp;long=-71.116179</code>.
According to the ABNF in <a href="http://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3986">RFC 3986</a>?</li>
<li class="nest">

<ol class="qa">
<li class="q">The nonterminal (rule) that matches <code>http</code> is?</li>
<li class="a">':'</li>
<li class="q">The nonterminal that matches <code>lat=42.408724&amp;long=-71.116179</code> is?</li>
<li class="a">';'</li>
<li class="q">True or false, the URI has a <code>hier-part</code>?</li>
<li class="a">True. example.com/maps</li>
<li class="q">True or false, the URI has a <code>path</code>?</li>
<li class="a">True. /maps</li>
</ol>
